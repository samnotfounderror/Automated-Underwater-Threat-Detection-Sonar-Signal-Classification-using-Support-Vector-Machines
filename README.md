## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** to classify underwater sonar signals as either **naval mines (metal cylinders)** or **natural rocks**. The system analyzes 60 frequency-band features from acoustic backscatter data to make real-time threat detection decisions with **81%+ accuracy**.

**Real-world application**: This technology can be deployed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), submarines, and naval surveillance systems to automatically identify underwater threats without human intervention.

## 📊 Dataset

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Source** | UCI Machine Learning Repository |
| **Samples** | 208 observations (111 mines, 97 rocks) |
| **Features** | 60 numerical values (0.0-1.0 range) |
| **Labels** | 'M' (Mine) and 'R' (Rock) |
| **Data Type** | Acoustic sonar backscatter signals |

Each feature represents the **energy within a specific frequency band** of the sonar signal, integrated over a particular time period—creating a unique "acoustic fingerprint" for each object.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### Models Evaluated

| Model | Test Accuracy | Strengths |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | **81.0%** | Best for high-dimensional feature spaces |
| Random Forest | 76.2% | Handles non-linear relationships |
| Logistic Regression | 76.2% | Fast and interpretable |
